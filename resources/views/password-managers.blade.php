        <div>
            Remembering dozens of username and password combinations can be a daunting task.
            For this reason, many users use a single, oftentimes way too simplistic password across multiple websites and applications. This puts their accounts at great risk of being hijacked by bad actors, with potentially disastrous consequences.
            A short, simple password is way easier to crack than a long, complex one, and when a password is cracked on one website, bad actors will immediately try to use the same password on other websites and get into the victim's account.
            <br><br>
            Of course, having to remember strong passwords for each of your accounts is rather inconvenient.
            This is where password managers can make your online experience just a bit easier.
            <br><br>
            Password managers are computer programs that do exactly what you expect:
            they generate, store and manage passwords for your convenience.
            This way, you can generate a secure password for each website without having to remember all of them. By encrypting your information, password managers make it difficult for bad actors to steal your data.
            Password managers use a ‘master password’, which you can use to show your login details for various websites. Additional security may be enabled in the form of Two-Factor Authentication.
            Now, instead of having to remember a dozen different passwords, you only need to remember the master password of your password manager.
